# ColdEmailGPT: From Job Link to Perfect Outreach Message

### I developed an intelligent system that helps job seekers streamline cold outreach. By simply pasting a job link, the AI extracts key skills and requirements, matches them with the user's portfolio, and automatically generates a personalized cold email that can be sent to the hiring manager ‚Äî saving time while increasing the chances of engagement.
